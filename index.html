                            Frontend and backend are two critical aspects of any application. The frontend is what your users see and includes visual elements like buttons, checkboxes, graphics, and text messages. It allows your users to interact with your application. The backend is the data and infrastructure that make your application work.

                            In general, it is observed that the back-end developers are paid higher than the front-end developers. Also, back-end development requires huge skills (in terms of coding and DSA). Considering these factors, people consider the backend better than the front end.

                            The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user. Most data and operating syntax are stored and accessed in the back end of a computer system.
